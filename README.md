# Snake-Game-Playable-Automation-Using-Coordinates
This Project Has 2 Programs. One Is 'Snake Game.py' which is playable game. Another one is'Game Snake Optimizer.py' which is automated game using coordinates.

<h2> Pygame </h2>
I used PyGame Module to build a snake game in python.

<h3> 'Snake Game.py' </h3>
'Snake Game.py' is played by using arrow keys. User have to catch the food (apple here) with the snake's head.
 Everytime the snake catches the food, the size of the snake increases by 1 grid.
 If the snake's head touches its own body or border frame, the game over.
 I Kept a highscore tracker using text file.
 
<h3> 'Game Snake Optimizer.py' </h3>
'Game Snake Optimizer.py' is similar to 'Game Snake.py' in terms of look but performs on its own.
 It catches the food, using its coordinates.
 It creates a path to escape from catching its own body, when needed.
 It grows to its maximum size possible & reaches eternity.
